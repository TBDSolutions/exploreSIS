## About
This repo contains the [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) user interface and server structure to produce an interactive application for analysis of [Supports Intensity Scale](https://aaidd.org/publications/supports-intensity-scale#.VsU2kObNUrc) (SIS) data.  

## This repo is for UI and reactive data scripts
Please feel free to fork this repo if you want to make changes to the reactive data structure or add new visualizations or interactivity.

If you want to clean and manage your own SIS data using this interface, you should fork and clone the exploreSIS_node repo and change the local variables in those scripts to grab and clean your own data.  The 'node' repo grabs updated copies of the `ui.R` and `server.R` scripts from this repo so new functionality should be updated (*and potentially new bugs as well, so test thoroughly!*)
